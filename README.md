## EA FC 24 Automated SBC Solving âš½

### Notes
`The goal is to automatically solve the SBC using the currently available players in the club with the minimum cost based on futbin prices.`

The project utilizes [tamper monkey script](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) to output the users Club Player Data.
Install the tampermonkey extension and then install [the frontend script](https://github.com/ThomasSteere/AI-SBC/raw/main/tampermonkey-ai-sbc.user.js)

This script implements a number of backend functions but the main feature is a Solve SBC button on each SBC that send players to the backend solver

Players will also get SBC Lock button to not send use this player in the solution (if its a duplicate it will get sent)
Also a must use button is available which will set the cost of this player to 0 so it will get used if it can be fit into the SBC

The constraints used in the program are created in the `optimize.py` file and the optimization problem is solved using [Google CP-SAT solver](https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/cp_solver).

The program implements the SBC requirements in `optimize.py`.

To run the backend, simply run `python -m uvicorn main:app --reload` after installing the required dependencies.
